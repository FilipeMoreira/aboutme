				<p>My name is Filipe Marques Moreira, I'm a brazilian undergrad student pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science degree
					in Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in Brazil. Since September, 2015 I've been taking classes at Pace
					University in New York, USA, as an exchange student from the Science Without Borders mobility program.</p><br>
				<p>Before starting my Computer Science studies I went to Computational Mathematics college for two and a half years. After I knew
					I had a strong mathematical basis I moved to Computer Science. Math college brought me great knowledge in areas like
					calculus, algebra, linear algebra, numerical analysis and geometry.</p><br>
				<p>Appart from classwork I've been involved in some works and projects through my college life so far from web development 
					to back-end systems and database concept and implementation.
					I have also worked with game development on a project to support the learning of autistic children, a RFID based 
					security system for Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) campus and 
					I was a teaching assistant for that subject at Fluminense Federal University (Brazil). 
					I love to create creative algorithms to solve problems in fast ways.</p><br>
				<p>In the US I'm being able to learn new things and from different angles.
					 On November 9th this year I won 
					a fast game creation competition on a Microsoft hosted workshop that took place at Pace University.</p><br>
				<p>Right now, during this spring semester, I'm looking for a internship for the summer to complete my experience and
					improve my abilities and knowledge. Software Engineering and Web Development are areas I'm really interested into
					working with.</p>
					<br>
				<p>Also, beyond computers and all the technology arts, I am a guitar player and music, movies and theatre lover.</p>
